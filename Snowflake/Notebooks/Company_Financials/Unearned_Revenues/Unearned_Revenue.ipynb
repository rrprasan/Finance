The company that receives the prepayment records the amount as deferred revenue, a liability on its balance sheet. (Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp#:~:text=Deferred%20revenue%2C%20also%20known%20as,liability%20on%20its%20balance%20sheet.))\n\n### Software companies in the SaaS and IaaS business, sell multi-year contracts to their customers. The [FASB](https://fasb.org/) sets the accounting standards in the U.S. and they, along with the [IFRS](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-accounting-standards-board/), have determined the rules for how revenue from long-running contracts are recongnized.   \n### Studying the unearned revenue may offer clues to the amount of revenue the company has already booked for the next fiscal year.  \n### We will compare the latest unearned revenue data against the last available annual revenue and calculate the percentage of the _**next fiscal year's annual revenue**_ the company already has in deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue over the next fiscal year.     \n"
