### From Pixels to Ratios: Calculate Financial Ratios Directly From Images 📈
Valuable financial data doesn't always live in clean, structured tables. It's often locked away in PDFs 📄, Excel, Word, Google Sheets, investor reports, and even screenshots 🖼️ — mostly unstructured, inaccessible, and expensive to process.

For decades, the answer was either costly contracts with data vendors 💸 or countless hours of error-prone manual data entry 😫. But what if you could bypass all of that?

## What if you could treat an image of a balance sheet just like a database table? 🤯

This notebook demonstrates the new frontier of financial analysis. We will use Snowflake's built-in **AISQL** capabilities 🤖 to feed a multimodal Large Language Model an image of a company's balance sheet. With a simple prompt, we will direct the AI to:

- ### See and Understand the contents of the image. 👀
- ### Extract the specific values for Total Liabilities and Total Equity. 🔢
- ### Calculate the Debt-to-Equity ratio on the fly. 🧮
- ### No manual transcription. No complex data pipelines. 
    - ### Just a picture, a prompt, and powerful insights delivered in seconds. ⚡
